# DecodeCongestion Hackathon 2019

## Introduction

“Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink”

Nowhere is this analogy better applied than to the world of data now. Ultimately, data are only as useful as the insight that they can generate and given the current exponential growth of data, it is easier to be overwhelmed when trying to make sense of all the data we have on our hands.   

Similarly, with the City of Vancouver’s growing focus on data usage to tackle various key challenges in transportation, extracting useful insights from database will become an ever-growing challenge. Thus, introducing our Vancouver Liveability Index (VLI)  

VLI is a powerful tool to simplify this staggering amount of information into key indices which could be conveniently accessed by anyone from a single dashboard. With drag-and-drop interface that allows for quick and easy policy evaluation, our product will assist key stakeholders to incorporate data-driven key insights from the VLI dashboard in their every discussion.
